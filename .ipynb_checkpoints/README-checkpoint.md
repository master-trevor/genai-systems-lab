# 🧪 GenAI Systems Lab

Welcome to the **GenAI Systems Lab** — a hands-on notebook and code repository where I explore, test, and document everything related to building and deploying GenAI systems.

This repo tracks my journey from raw prompt engineering all the way to local inference, tool usage, and full-on AI agents.

---

## 📚 Phase Overview

### Phase 01 – Prompting Foundations
- Learn and apply Chain of Thought (CoT), ReAct prompting, and function calling.
- Build a prompt library.
- Compare prompting techniques via OpenAI’s GPT-4 API.

### Phase 02 – Local & Open-Source Models
- Run Hugging Face models for text generation, summarization, and Q&A.
- Compare performance vs. OpenAI’s APIs.
- Test offline/local inference options.

### Phase 03 – Agent Systems
- Build simple LangChain agents.
- Connect GPT-4 to tools using function calling.
- Chain logic, reasoning, and actions for task-solving workflows.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- OpenAI API (`openai`)
- Hugging Face `transformers`
- LangChain (for agents)
- Streamlit / FastAPI (optional frontend deployments)

## 🧠 Goal

To master the full GenAI stack by building working systems — not just learning theory. Every folder in this repo represents a building block in the AI engineer's toolkit.
